                   LFSPGooglePlacesAutocomplete is a simple objective-c wrapper around the Google Places Autocomplete API.

                   The API can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based geographic searches, by returning Places such as businesses, addresses, and points of interest as a user types.
                   LFSPGooglePlacesAutocomplete also provides support for converting Place results into CLPlacemark objects for easy mapping with MKMapView.
